            <p>Sweetheart, I wanted to write you a love letter. I know it‚Äôs a little silly, but I‚Äôd try anyway. It‚Äôs
                just that I feel so much when I‚Äôm with you that I try to put it in words so that you know how I feel
                about you. You are such a gift to me. Having you in my life is such a blessing. You are my happiness, my
                heart‚Äôs desire, my everlasting flame, the one that makes my heart beat fast. My love, my queen, I cannot
                think for a second without you in my mind. I cherish you, princess of beauty. They say pictures are
                worth a thousand words, but I can only say three words when I look at your picture: I love you. A girl
                like you with a heart of gold deserves all the good things in this life, and I am prepared to go the
                extra mile to see you have these in your life; I know you would do the same for me even more, that‚Äôs a
                fact. When I look into your eyes, I am connected to your soul; all I see is profound love. I see a
                reminder of why I must work hard to give you everything you will ever need. You have made me a complete
                person. Thank you, my love. I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for everything you‚Äôve done for me.
                Thank you for loving, accepting, unconditionally, and providing undivided love and attention. You‚Äôve
                been there for me through everything. Thank you for helping me grow into the man I have become. In love
                alphabets, ‚ÄòU‚Äô and ‚ÄòI‚Äô were placed close to each other because Without U (You), I (am) nothing. I find
                my purpose in your sight and exist for your love forever. A day without you makes me want to question
                planet Earth‚Äôs existence. Dear love, you keep me going even on my most vulnerable days. Without you, I
                cannot breathe; I am incomplete. I love you so much, babe. You and I, both ending up together, was not
                an accident. Our story was written in the stars even before we met each other. I thank God every day
                from the core of my heart for this! I wish you knew how much I adore you. I love you!</p>
