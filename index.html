            <p>Sweetheart, I wanted to write you a love letter. I know it’s a little silly, but I’d try anyway. It’s
                just that I feel so much when I’m with you that I try to put it in words so that you know how I feel
                about you. You are such a gift to me. Having you in my life is such a blessing. You are my happiness, my
                heart’s desire, the one that makes my heart beat fast. My love, my queen, I cannot
                think for a second without you in my mind. I cherish you. They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but I can only say three words when I look at your picture: I love you. A girl
                like you with a heart of gold deserves all the good things in this life, and I am prepared to go the
                extra mile to see you have these in your life; I know you would do the same for me even more, that’s a
                fact. When I look into your eyes, I am connected to your soul. I see a
                reminder of why I must work hard to give you everything you will ever need. You have made me a complete
                person.
                Thank you for loving, accepting, unconditionally, and providing undivided love and attention. You’ve
                been there for me through everything. Thank you for helping me grow into the man I have become. I find
                my purpose in your sight and exist for your love forever. A day without you makes me want to question
                planet Earth’s existence. Dear love, you keep me going even on my most vulnerable days. Without you, I
                cannot breathe; I am incomplete. I love you so much, babe. Our story was written in the stars even before we met each other. I thank God every day
                from the core of my heart for this! I wish you knew how much I adore you. I love you!</p>
